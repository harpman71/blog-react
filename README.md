# Blog React v 1.0

Blog developed from the project of the CSS layout course in Platzi. In it I implement Sass and React, technologies applied in other courses of the same platform.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3068](http://localhost:3068) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
